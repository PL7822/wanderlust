‚úÖ **Important notes:**
1. Make sure your **Render app is live and publicly accessible**. If Render gives a private or staging URL, clicking the link won‚Äôt work for everyone.
2. Make sure the **GitHub URL exists and is public**.  
3. If you want, I can **rewrite the README with GitHub-style badges, screenshots, and live demo buttons** so that it looks fully clickable and professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?



If you want, I can also make a **shorter, cleaner version with badges and a professional look** suitable for GitHub so it looks like a production-ready repo README.  

Do you want me to do that?
